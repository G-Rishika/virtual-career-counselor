🎓 Virtual Career Counselor
📌 Project Overview

Virtual Career Counselor is a web-based application designed to guide users in exploring suitable career paths based on their interests, skills, and preferences. The project aims to simulate a simplified career counseling experience through an interactive and structured digital platform.

The system bridges the gap between career uncertainty and informed decision-making by presenting career-related information in an accessible and organized manner. It is built with a strong focus on clarity, usability, and extensibility, making it suitable for academic, demonstrative, and early-stage professional use.

🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

Provide users with career guidance through a digital interface

Demonstrate the integration of backend logic, frontend rendering, and database handling

Serve as a foundational model for future enhancements such as AI-driven recommendations or analytics

🧠 Project Description

The Virtual Career Counselor operates as a Flask-based web application that interacts with users through web pages rendered using HTML templates. User inputs and career-related data are processed on the backend and stored using a lightweight database system.

The application is structured to ensure:

Clear separation between logic, presentation, and data

Maintainability and scalability

Ease of future integration with intelligent systems

🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Backend

Python

Flask Framework – for routing, request handling, and application logic

🔹 Frontend

HTML – for page structure

CSS – for styling and layout

🔹 Database

SQLite – for storing user and career-related data

🔹 Tools & Libraries

Flask extensions and Python libraries as specified in requirements.txt

🗂️ System Architecture (High-Level)

User Interface Layer
Handles user interaction via web pages

Application Logic Layer
Processes inputs, applies logic, and controls flow

Data Layer
Stores and retrieves information from local databases

This layered approach ensures modularity and cleaner data flow throughout the application.

📁 Project Structure Overview

The project follows a structured and readable organization:

Backend logic files for application control

Template files for rendering user interfaces

Static assets for styling and visuals

Database files for persistent storage

This structure supports both development clarity and future expansion.
